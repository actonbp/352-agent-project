# Team Simulation Project Guide

Welcome to the Team Simulation Project for Leadership 352! This guide will help you get started with your team simulation, even if you've never used GitHub before.

## üëã Getting Started

**Don't worry if you're not familiar with GitHub!** You can access all the materials you need directly through this website without needing to clone or download the repository.

### What You'll Find Here

- [Project Overview](#project-overview): What this project is about and what you can learn
- [Assignment Instructions](#assignment-instructions): Step-by-step guides for completing your assignments
- [Simulation Modules](#simulation-modules): Ready-to-use simulation models for your project
- [Examples](#examples): Sample simulations to help you understand how everything works
- [Resources](#resources): Additional resources and guides

## üìù Assignment Instructions

### Check-in 1: Research Question and Simulation Design

Your first assignment is to develop a research question and design your simulation.

1. Download the [Check-in 1 Worksheet](../check_in_1_worksheet.docx) (Right-click and select "Save link as...")
2. Download the [Check-in 1 Summary Template](../check_in_1_summary_template.docx) (Right-click and select "Save link as...")
3. Complete both documents with your team
4. Submit through the course management system by the due date

Need help? See the [Research Question Guide](research_question_guide.md) for tips on developing effective research questions.

## ü§ñ Simulation Modules

You'll be using AI-powered simulation modules to explore team dynamics. The repository includes:

### Leadership Style Simulation

Explore how different leadership styles (authoritarian, democratic, laissez-faire, transformational) affect team performance.
