# Developing Effective Research Questions

A strong research question is the foundation of a successful team simulation project. This guide will help you develop a clear, specific question that can be answered through your simulation.

## Characteristics of Good Research Questions

An effective research question for your team simulation should be:

1. **Specific**: Clearly identifies the variables you're examining
2. **Measurable**: Can be answered with observable data from your simulation
3. **Relevant**: Connects to team leadership concepts from the course
4. **Feasible**: Can be answered through a simulation given available tools

## Question Formula

A simple formula for creating a research question is:

> How does [independent variable] affect [dependent variable] in [specific context]?

Examples:
- "How does leadership style (authoritarian vs. democratic) affect team creativity during problem-solving tasks?"
- "How does the presence of a deviant member affect the quality of team decisions?"
- "How do high vs. low inclusion practices impact participation rates in diverse teams?"

## Steps to Develop Your Research Question

### 1. Identify Your Topic Area

Start by selecting a broad topic from team leadership concepts covered in class:
- Leadership styles
- Team diversity
- Psychological safety
- Decision-making processes
- Communication patterns
- Conflict management
- Role distribution

### 2. Narrow Your Focus

Identify a specific aspect of your topic that interests you:
- Instead of "leadership styles," focus on "democratic vs. authoritarian leadership"
- Instead of "team diversity," focus on "cognitive diversity in problem-solving"

### 3. Formulate Your Question

Turn your focused topic into a question that shows the relationship between variables:
- Instead of "leadership and creativity," ask "How does democratic leadership (compared to authoritarian leadership) affect team creativity in open-ended problem-solving tasks?"

### 4. Test Your Question

Ensure your question can be answered through a simulation by asking:
- Can I manipulate the independent variable in my simulation? (e.g., leadership style)
- Can I measure the dependent variable? (e.g., creativity of solutions)
- Can I create a simulation scenario that fits this question? (e.g., a creative problem-solving task)

## Examples of Research Questions for Different Topics

### Leadership Styles
- How does transformational leadership versus transactional leadership affect team member satisfaction during complex projects?
- How does laissez-faire leadership affect team coordination compared to directive leadership in crisis situations?

### Team Diversity
- How does cognitive diversity affect the quality of solutions for complex problems compared to homogeneous teams?
- How does demographic diversity affect psychological safety in team discussions?

### Decision Making
- How does structured versus unstructured decision-making processes affect time to consensus in diverse teams?
- How does the presence of status differences affect equal participation in team decision-making?

### Psychological Safety
- How do different feedback methods affect psychological safety in newly formed teams?
- How does the leader's response to mistakes affect team members' willingness to take risks?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too Broad**: "How does leadership affect teams?" (Too general)
- **Too Narrow**: "How does the exact wording of a democratic leader's third question affect creativity in solving a specific puzzle?" (Too specific for simulation)
- **Unmeasurable**: "What is the best leadership style?" (Can't be directly measured)
- **Unrelated to Simulation**: "How do team members feel about their childhoods?" (Not relevant or measurable in simulation)

## Connecting to Course Concepts

Make sure your research question connects to theories and concepts from the course:
- If examining leadership, consider connecting to specific leadership theories
- If looking at communication patterns, connect to models of team communication
- If investigating diversity, link to concepts about team composition and performance

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Does my question explore a meaningful relationship between variables?
- Is the scope appropriate for the simulation framework we're using?
- Will the results provide insights relevant to real-world team leadership?
- Does my question build on concepts we've covered in class?
- Could the findings be potentially valuable in actual team settings?

Remember, a good research question leads naturally to a simulation design, with clear variables to manipulate and outcomes to measure.
