# GitHub Basics for Students

If you've never used GitHub before, don't worry! This guide will help you understand the basics of how to navigate GitHub and access the resources you need for your simulation project.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform where code and documentation can be stored, shared, and collaborated on. For this course, we're using GitHub to:

1. Share the simulation modules you'll use for your project
2. Provide documentation and examples
3. Host this website for easy access to all resources

## Accessing Resources Without Git

The good news is that you don't need to install Git or learn Git commands to complete this assignment! Here's how to access everything you need:

### Browsing Files on GitHub

1. Visit the [repository homepage](https://github.com/actonbp/352-agent-project)
2. You'll see a list of files and folders in the main view
3. Click on any folder to navigate into it
4. Click on any file to view its contents

## Finding What You Need

Here's where to find key resources for your assignment:

- **Assignment Templates**: Look in the root folder for `check_in_1_worksheet.docx` and `check_in_1_summary_template.docx`
- **Simulation Code**: The `src` folder contains all the simulation modules
- **Examples**: The `examples` folder contains sample simulations and tutorials
- **Guides**: Look in the `docs` folder for detailed guides on various topics

## Using This Website

This website (GitHub Pages) is designed to be a more user-friendly way to access project information:

1. Use the navigation links to find documentation on specific topics
2. Follow the step-by-step guides for setting up and running simulations
3. Download required files directly from the links provided

## Common GitHub Terms

If you're curious about some GitHub terminology you might encounter:

- **Repository (Repo)**: A project folder containing all files and their history
- **README**: A file that provides an overview of the project (like a home page)
- **Clone**: Making a copy of the repository on your local computer
- **Commit**: A saved change to files in the repository
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the repository (we're using the "main" branch)
